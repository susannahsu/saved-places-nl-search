## 🎯 Project Goals

This is primarily a **portfolio project** to demonstrate:
- Product management skills (PRD, user research, metrics)
- Full-stack engineering (React, TypeScript, Chrome Extensions)
- ML integration (embeddings, semantic search)
- System design and architecture

## 🤝 How to Contribute

While this is a portfolio project, contributions are welcome! Here's how you can help:

### Reporting Bugs

1. Check if the bug has already been reported in [Issues](../../issues)
2. If not, create a new issue with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Screenshots if applicable
   - Your environment (OS, Chrome version, etc.)

### Suggesting Features

1. Check [Issues](../../issues) for existing feature requests
2. Create a new issue with:
   - Clear use case
   - Why it would be valuable
   - How it might work
   - Any implementation ideas

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. **Make your changes:**
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add tests if applicable
   - Update documentation
4. **Test your changes:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run build:extension
   ```
5. **Commit with clear messages:**

- Follow existing patterns and conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### Testing

- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Test the extension manually in Chrome

### Documentation

- Update README.md if adding user-facing features
- Update docs/ if changing architecture
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
